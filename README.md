## CTY (Chester Huang, Yedoh Kang, Tiffany Moi)
### APCS1 pd5 Final Project

<br /> 

### Project Description:
##### Simulate your own Animal Circus! You are a trainer, and you will be able to buy animals and train them, given a certain amount of money when you start. After buying and training your animals, you will run the circus! During the circus, you will play Fit the Animal, where you will place animals in the Game Board. If the audience likes your animals' tricks, you will receive their ticket money and fame points. After, you can continue running the Circus, or continue to buy and train animals. When you run out of moves, you will be able to run one more round of the Circus, and you will receive the total amount of ticket money you received, the total amount of fame points, and the total revenue you made while playing this game.
